System Mechanics: Safeguards Against Abuse
This document describes the specific technical mechanisms that ensure the system remains transparent and resistant to manipulation.

1. Proof of Reason (PoR)
Unlike traditional voting, where only the "result" is seen, every proposal in this system must be accompanied by a logical justification processed by the AI.

Traceable Logic: The AI breaks down the proposal into potential consequences.

Data Integrity: Any data used to justify a decision is hashed and stored permanently. If the data is later proven false, the decision is automatically flagged for review.

2. Dynamic Influence & Slashing
The power of a participant is not static. It is a "Weight of Influence" that changes based on the outcome of their decisions.

Accountability: If a participant proposes or votes for a decision that violates the "Digital Constitution," their influence weight is automatically reduced (Slashing).

Skin in the Game: Proposing a major change requires a "reputation stake." If the change is successful and beneficial, the stake grows; if it is a failure, the stake is lost.

3. The "Anti-Night" Delay (Time-Locks)
To prevent "flash coups" or sudden changes in rules:

Activation Lag: Any change to core parameters has a mandatory waiting period (e.g., 7 days).

Public Alert: During this period, the AI is programmed to broadcast the change and its potential risks to all participants.

Veto Window: Participants can mobilize to block a malicious change before it becomes active.

4. Influence Ceilings (Anti-Whale Mechanism)
To prevent the system from being bought by the wealthy:

Quadratic Voting/Funding: The cost of influence increases quadratically. Doubling your power costs four times as much.

Sybil Resistance: Proof-of-Personhood protocols ensure that one person cannot create a thousand fake accounts to manipulate the consensus.

5. AI Multi-Audit
To prevent "AI Bias" or hacking of the central model:

Cross-Verification: Every critical decision is analyzed by at least three independent AI models with different architectures.

Discrepancy Trigger: If the models disagree on the safety of a proposal, the "Pause" button is hit, and the decision is moved to a high-level human/expert review.

6. Immutable Ledger of Dialogue
The dialogue between the Human and the AI is the "Source of Truth."

No Deletion: No admin, developer, or elite can delete a record of a conversation or a decision.

Public Audit: Any user can run a local node to verify that the current state of the system matches the history of all previous actions.
