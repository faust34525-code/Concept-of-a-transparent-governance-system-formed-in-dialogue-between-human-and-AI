Call for Implementation: Seeking Maintainers and Developers
Note from the Author: I am the visionary behind this concept, but I recognize that its realization requires deep technical expertise in AI, Blockchain, and System Architecture. I am releasing this idea to the world because its implementation is more important than my personal authorship.

📢 My Goal
I want this system to be built and deployed as quickly as possible. I am looking for competent developers, engineers, and organizations to take this concept and turn it into a working product.

🛠 How You Can Help
Take Ownership: If you have the resources and skills, feel free to fork this repository, build a team, and start development.

Technical Specification: Help translate the logic described in MECHANICS.md into actual code (Smart Contracts, AI Agent protocols).

Architecture Audit: Review the proposed mechanisms for flaws and suggest more robust technical solutions.

Collaboration: If you are building something similar, let’s integrate these transparency principles into your project.

⚖️ License & Openness
This project is intended to be Open Source. It must remain transparent and accessible to everyone, otherwise, it violates its own core principle.

📩 Get Involved
If you are ready to take this project to the next level, please open an Issue or submit a Pull Request. I am happy to provide further conceptual guidance while you lead the technical execution.

Let's build a future where abuse of power is a thing of the past.
